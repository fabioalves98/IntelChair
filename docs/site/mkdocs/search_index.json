On a daily basis he sits on different desks and working stations, be them soldering, printing or the coffee station. He also moves things around the laboratory depending on what he is working at the moment.

Sometimes he needs to move from places in order to get something that he needs. Ramalho decides to go to the vending machine which is quite far from his desk, but he had a full and tiring day. Given his location and the machine's location, he is able to travel to his destination of choice without getting tired.\n\n\n#2 - Chair goes from point A to point B transporting items\n\n\nRog\u00e9rio as told before, is an investigator from IRIS Lab. His work often demands extra equipment and components which are located at other buildings. Because this task is very demanding for Rog\u00e9rio, he can send the chair to get the components for him. This requires him to input the location and the chair does all the work.\n\n\n#3 - Chair follows human while transporting items\n\n\nIn many situations we struggle to transport items, mainly because they are too many or heavy. The solution to this is, most of the times, carry one by one, but that can become an exhausting task. The chair can carry those items and follow its user around wherever he/she goes.",
