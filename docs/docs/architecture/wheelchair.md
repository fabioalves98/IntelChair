The core part of the wheelchair, linking every node in the system, is a laptop. It communicates with the wheelchair's control unit through a gateway microcontroller and processes information about every sensor in the wheelchair.
The wheelchair holds a camera for object recognition and collision detection, as well as a laser rangefinder and IMU for room mapping and navigation.
