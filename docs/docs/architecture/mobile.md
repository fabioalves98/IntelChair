The mobile application allows the user to either take control of the wheelchair or choose a goal and make it navigate autonomously. It enables the user to define default locations to the current working map and travel between those, or simply travel to an arbitrary location chosen by him. It also displays some information about the wheelchair's current battery levels and the current maximum speed.
