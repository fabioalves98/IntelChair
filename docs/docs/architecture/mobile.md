The mobile application is the way the user interacts with the system. So we can divide the mobile app in three parts, the manual control menu where the user have access to a joystick and can control the wheelchair, it also displays some information about the wheelchair's current battery levels and the possibility of changing the current maximum speed. A mapping tab intended for a user with permissions to perform the mapping of the room through the control of the chair. At least, we have the navigation menu, It enables the user to simply travel to an arbitrary location chosen by him. The user only need to choose a position in the map and an orientation and the information is sent to the chair.
