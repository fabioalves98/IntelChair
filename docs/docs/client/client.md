## Context
In many working environments, a person may need to do short travels between locations a lot of times during the day. While doing so, it wastes time, focus and energy. That same time could be used more efficiently if there was something that could take care of the mobility of the person for her. If there was a way for the user to travel between those short locations, but still remain focused on his work, be it on a computer or smartphone, it would increase his producticity by a large margin.

## Objectives
In that sense comes the IntelChair, a motorized wheelchair packed with sensors and a computer, that takes care of transporting people from location to location, without it's user ever need to pay atention to the course of the deslocation. It does so by learning it's environment, presenting the user with a top-down view of said enviroment and letting him choose where he wants to go. The interaction between the chair and the user is done through an application on his smartphone.
