## Context
**UberChair** is not your typical eletric wheelchair. This chair was designed by our to help not only people with reduced mobility, but also regular people who need an extra "hand" at work or are too lazy. However, our focus will be with those who are disabled in order to provide them a better way of transportation.

## Problem
What has driven us to develop this product? Manual wheelchairs depend directly on its user and its mobility. Most of the times, the user is not strong enough to push himself so requires the help of another person. Also, in some specific cases, it can be very hard to the helper to drive those chairs.
