## What is the IntelChair?

Our project consists of a motorized wheelchair that can autonomously move itself in a known enviroment, giving the user the ability of handsfree mobility while sitting in the chair. For more details visit the [client](client/client.md) page.

## Who will use it?

With this project we don't have a particular target audience. Anyone can use our chair, but it is possible to find more information on use cases and scenarios in the [vision](vision/personas.md) page.

## How will it be used?

The IntelChair will be used in conjunction with a mobile application with which the user can control all of its functions. For more information visit the [manual](manual.md) page.

## How does it work technically?

All the information about implementation details can be consulted in the [architecture](architecture.md) page.

## How can I contribute?

If you wish to deploy our system or contribute in any way, see how in the [developer](developer.md) page.

## Who are we?

You can read more about the team and our progress on the [team](team/team.md) page.
