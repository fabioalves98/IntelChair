## What is the IntelChair?

IntelChair consists of a motorized wheelchair that can autonomously move itself in a known environment, giving the user the ability of hands free mobility while sitting in the chair. For more details visit the [client](client/client.md) page.

## How will it be used?

The IntelChair will be used in conjunction with a mobile application with which the user can control all of its functions. For more information visit the [manual](manual.md) page.

## How does it work technically?

All the information about implementation details can be consulted in the [architecture](architecture/system.md) page.
