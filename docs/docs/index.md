# What is IntelChair?

Our project consists of a motorized wheelchair that can autonomously move itself in a known enviroment, giving the user the ability of handsfree mobility while sitting in the chair. For more details visit the [client] page.

# How will it be used?

The wheelchair will be used in conjunction with a mobile application with which the user can control all the functions of the chair. For more information visit the [manual] page.
