## Enviroment
* For proper function of the wheelchair's features, the environment must be plane, absent of any ramps or significant bumps on the floor.
* Since the rangefinder has a maximum detection range of 20 meters, the envirnoment must not have wide areas absent of objects. Otherwise the wheelchair will not be able to map those specific areas.
* Glass objects such has windows or doors made of glass will also not be mapped since the rangefinder and depth camera work via infrared light reflection.
* In the sense of the previous restriction, there shouldn't be present any other device that emmits infrared ligths in the environment, since it will interfer with the wheelchair's sensors.

## Usability
* The wheelchair supports a maximum user weigth of 120kg.
* The rangefinder should not be couvered at any time. The user cannot, for example, rest his coat on the back of the wheelchair.
* The same goes for the depth camera in front of the wheelchair which can be blocked if the user is not careful with his legs.


## Technical
* Energy managment is not autonomous. This means the wheelchair will not dock itself for recharging when it detects a low percentage of battery. It will however notifie the user.
