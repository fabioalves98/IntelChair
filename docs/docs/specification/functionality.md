## Manual Control
The first time a user opens the mobile application he will be presented with a virtual joystick with which he can control the wheelchair. This joystick maps the wheelchair's movement directly, just like the joystick that came with the wheelcahir (now removed). He can also change the wheelchair's maximum velocity between 5 levels and see the current battery capacity.

## Map Generation
In this mode, a map of the surrounding enviroment can be generated by the wheelchair. To do so, the user will use the virtual joystick to move the wheelchair arround. The wheelchair's computer will then gather data from the sensors to feed the mapping generation algorithm. Once enough data is captured the user will be presented with the final version of the map which he then can edit or use for navigation.

## Navigation 
When the map of the current environemnt is already generated and acessible, the wheelchair can then find it's position on it and inform the user, which can then select any point on the map and make the wheelchair travel to it by itself. We also give the possibility of setting predefined locations and having the wheelchair travel between them.

## Object Detection
Because map used for the navigation of the wheelchair is static and created beforehand, a depth camera is placed in front of the wheelchair and used to detect objects in the wheelchair's path that might appear and were not caugth in the mapping stage, by the rangefinder.
