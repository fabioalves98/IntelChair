## Manual Control
The first time a user opens the mobile application he will be presented with a virtual joystick with which he can control the wheelchair. This joystick maps the wheelchair's movement directly, just like the joystick that came with the wheelcahir (now removed). He can also change the wheelchair's maximum velocity between 5 levels and see the current battery capacity.

## Map Generation
In this mode, a map of the surrounding enviroment can be generated by the wheelchair. To do so, the user will use the virtual joystick to move the wheelchair arround. The wheelchair's computer will then gather data from the sensors to feed the mapping generation algorithm. Once enough data is captured the user will be presented with the final version of the map which he then can edit or use for navigation.
