* Provide necessary information from the wheelchair like battery level
* Give the user the hability of saving certain locations for future use

### Server
* Accessible at all time, independent of wheelchair status
* Provide information exchange between the wheelchair and the client application
* Manage user access, restricting wheelchair control to one user only
