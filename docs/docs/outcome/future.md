Even though the main and core functionality that was initially proposed for the scope of this project was almost totally completed, some extra work and features that weren't specified in our documentation, neither in the main or extra features, were great ideas thrown not only by our mentors but by some of the group members as well.  

 * One of these ideas, and probably one of the first ones to arise, was the feature of having the chair travel to the user's current location. This consisted on replicating the idea of an uber or a taxi, but it was lately discarded, not because of it's complexity but because our main goal was to first have the chair move to an arbitrary location chosen by the user. Another good reason to discard this feature was the fact that it didn't have an easy fix on how to locate the user on the current existing map.

 * Other feature that we didn't really worry about, and simply specified the system with the non-existance of that specific feature, was the self-docking feature for the wheelchair. This would serve the purpose of, for example, have the chair park itself in a nearby docking station where it would charge the batteries. This was later re-iterated to work as just a "stop and warn the user when out of battery" but that wasn't implemented as well, for the same reason as the feature above.
